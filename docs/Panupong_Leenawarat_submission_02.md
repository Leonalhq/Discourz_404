I contributed to two major parts of this project. I designed User Interface for login, sign up, profile and edit profile pages. And, specially, my responsibility is to work on profile page. The profile page needs to show all user’s information, the user’s activities, and statistics. I needed to pull user information, created polls and debates of the user and display them in profile timeline. If the user clicks on a title of a poll, it will direct the user to the poll page. I think the most challenging part is to implement the view code that it needs to specifically request the user data from database. I implemented the urls.py to direct from profile page to edit profile page.  

I integrated my teammates’ work to the project. Jared and I implemented edit profile page. In the edit profile page, we allow users to edit their information.  I designed and implemented the templates of the edit profile (edit_profile.html, views.py, urls.py). I distributed the implementation of edit profile page to Jared since he worked on login and sign up page’s implementation before. I integrated Jared’s codes on edit profile with the project. 

I assisted with database design and data model. I came up with what data model we need to be stored in the database. I designed contact us page with its implement to display our project information such team’s member information and the project description.
