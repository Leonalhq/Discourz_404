We have finished the user authentication and interaction ahead of time, and, most of the requirements for this submission were already done in the second submission. I was working specifically on the poll part of the project. I implemented the back-end functionslity to allow a user to be able to vote only once.  Also, in the poll topic model, I included the user account field which will identify the user who created the poll.

We currently are working on the live debate and the live discussion part. However, we have been struggling to integrate them to the previous code, therefore, they will not be included in this subssion yet.

We have also been planning to update our user interface to be more intuitive and more attractive after we complete all the main components of the project.
