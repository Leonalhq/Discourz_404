# Innovative Idea

We want to build a debate website to let all the students to freely discuss hit and hot om campus. There are not that individual platfom at UMass to allow students to share opinions and poll topics. The idea is similar to existing debating websites such as debate.org, however, we would like to make our website innovative by only providing a live debate/discussion which we hope it will encorage people to actively engage to a debate more. Also each user will be able to check his/her statistics of all debates a user has participated such as how many votes he/she received.
