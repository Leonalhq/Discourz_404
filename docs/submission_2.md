Successes:
We are very good at using Django to build out back end infrastructure. We are very good at building the back end and database structure. Another success we had was our the construction of our User Interface. Our pages are simple to interact with, but smooth to interact with. We coded our interface to be user friendly. The debate, discussion, and post sections attempt to give a choice to the user with which method of communication they would be comfortable with.
