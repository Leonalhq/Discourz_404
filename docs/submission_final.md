Overview:
Our team decided to create an application where you could have discussions, debates and polls about various topics with different users of the application. Users would be able to create their own profiles, their own debates, and their own polls that other users could interact with in real time. This is innovative because it makes the debate more interesting since it is in real time between two people. They can interact quickly for an unlimited amount of time until one of them ends a the debate. It is also innovative because it allows other users to give their opinion on who won the debate with a vote that is counted in real time. In order for the debate and discussion section the redits server must be used

User Interface:

![example image](imgs/poll.png)

The above image is the poll view of our application where you are able to vote on a poll you or another user has created. Above shows an example question with example answers showing the answer the user selected. The user is an admin, because they are able to delete the post, as shown on the bottom of the page. 

![example image](imgs/discussion.png)

The above image shows an example of an ongoing discussion between two users, j4yrad and EvilJared. This discussion is in real time and allows many users to participate at once. 

![example image](imgs/login.png)

The above image shows an example of the login view of our application. You are able to enter your username and password and it logs you in. If you do not already have profile, there is a link to the sign up page.

![example image](imgs/search.png)
The above image shows an example of the search view. this allows users to search words and related posts come up in the results. You can filter between polls, debates, and discussions. 

![example image](imgs/signup.png)
The above image shows the sign up view. In this view, the user creates a username, password, enters their email, and creates a bio about themselves. This profile will be viewable to other users.

![example image](imgs/pastpolls.png)
The above image shows the view of the polls that can be sorted by most recent and most popular. The user can create a new poll or select a poll that has already been created. Clicking on the poll brings them to that view where they can vote on that poll. 

![example image](imgs/profile.png)
The above image shows the profile view of the application for a specific user. It shows their past polls,debates, and discussions and shows the number of polls and discussions the user has created. It also shows the number of debates the user has won or lost.

![example image](imgs/profile2.png)
The above image is also the profile view of the application, but it also shows what it looks like when someone wins a debate. It also shows tagged interests for the user.

Data Model:

URL Routes/Mappings:
#############

Authentication/Authorization:
Users are authenticated with basic sign up and sign in parts of the application. The admin has more permissions than the regular user's. He is able to delete polls while regular users are not. If a user is an admin, they will have a different view on the poll view than a regular user because they will be able to delete polls while the regular users will not have this option.

Team Choice:
Our team choice was to include a real time aspect to our application. We wanted discussions and debates to be in real time to make it more interesting. The votes on who won the debates is also in real time. We had to add URL routes for the discussion, debates, comments and search aspects of the application. 

Conclusion:
Overall, our team had a very postive experience working on this project. It was good to get to know eachother's strengths and weaknesses and learn to work to eachother's strengths. We learned all about creating a user interface, data models, URL routing, and authentication of the user. Putting together all this knowledge, we now have a broad overview of web programming. The biggest challenge that we faced as a group was organizing times where we could meet up and work on the project. Since we had a large group of 6 people, it was difficult to find a time where we could all meet. Other than this, we experienced some slight bugs along the way but they were easily fixable and did not negatively impact our progress. I think one thing we would have liked to know before starting the project would have been that we should start our code as early as possible like we started doing later in the semester in order to give ourselves plenty of tiem to make sure everything is perfect.
