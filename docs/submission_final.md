Overview:
Our team decided to create an application where you could have debates and polls about various topics with different users of the application. Users would be able to create their own profiles, their own debates, and their own polls that other users could interact with in real time. This is innovative because it makes the debate more interesting since it is in real time between two people. They can interact quickly for an unlimited amount of time until one of them ends a the debate. It is also innovative because it allows other users to give their opinion on who won the debate with a vote that is counted in real time. In order for the debate and discussion section the redits server must be used

User Interface:


Data Model:


URL Routes/Mappings:


Authentication/Authorization:
Users are authenticated with basic sign up and sign in parts of the application. The admin has more permissions than the regular user's. He is able to delete polls while regular users are not. If a user is an admin, they will have a different view on the poll view than a regular user because they will be able to delete polls while the regular users will not have this option.

Team Choice:
Our team choice was to include a real time aspect to our application. We wanted discussions and debates to be in real time to make it more interesting. The votes on who won the debates is also in real time. We had to add URL routes for the discussion, debates, comments and search aspects of the application.
