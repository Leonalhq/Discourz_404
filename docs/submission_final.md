Overview:
Our team decided to create an application where you could have discussions, debates and polls about various topics with different users of the application. Users would be able to create their own profiles, their own debates, and their own polls that other users could interact with in real time. This is innovative because it makes the debate more interesting since it is in real time between two people. They can interact quickly for an unlimited amount of time until one of them ends a the debate. It is also innovative because it allows other users to give their opinion on who won the debate with a vote that is counted in real time. In order for the debate and discussion section the redits server must be used

User Interface:

![example image](imgs/poll.png)

The above image is the poll view of our application where you are able to vote on a poll you or another user has created. Above shows an example question with example answers showing the answer the user selected. The user is an admin, because they are able to delete the post, as shown on the bottom of the page. 

![example image](imgs/discussion.png)
The above image shows an example of an ongoing discussion between two users, j4yrad and EvilJared. This discussion is in real time and allows many users to participate at once. 

Data Model:

#will send over when done####

URL Routes/Mappings:
###ask about later###

Authentication/Authorization:
Users are authenticated with basic sign up and sign in parts of the application. The admin has more permissions than the regular user's. He is able to delete polls while regular users are not. If a user is an admin, they will have a different view on the poll view than a regular user because they will be able to delete polls while the regular users will not have this option.

Team Choice:
Our team choice was to include a real time aspect to our application. We wanted discussions and debates to be in real time to make it more interesting. The votes on who won the debates is also in real time. We had to add URL routes for the discussion, debates, comments and search aspects of the application. 

Conclusion:
Overall, our team had a very postive experience working on this project. It was good to get to know eachother's strengths and weaknesses and learn to work to eachother's strengths. We learned all about creating a user interface, data models, URL routing, and authentication of the user. Putting together all this knowledge, we now have a broad overview of web programming. The biggest challenge that we faced as a group was organizing times where we could meet up and work on the project. Since we had a large group of 6 people, it was difficult to find a time where we could all meet. Other than this, we experienced some slight bugs along the way but they were easily fixable and did not negatively impact our progress. I think one thing we would have liked to know before starting the project would have been that we should start our code as early as possible like we started doing later in the semester in order to give ourselves plenty of tiem to make sure everything is perfect.
